# OSE Speed Provider
This module defines a `SpeedProvider` for use with [Drag Ruler][1]. It is intended for use with the [OSE system][2]. It defines three speeds:
* Base movement speed: how far you can move outside of combat in a turn.
* Base encounter speed: how far you can move in combat in a round. This value is half as much if you are engaged in melee (indicating a fighting a withdrawal).
* Retreat speed: how far you can move while in melee if you retreat.
